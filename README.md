This is an auxiliary character creation tool for our original TRPG game *Goofing Off Gods*, set in a self-contained fantasy world of the same name. 

Please note that the system is still under active development and has not been finalized.

The frontend is built primarily with JavaScript, with no backend implementation. Data is stored locally using IndexedDB.

**As I am not a professional JavaScript developer, I can't guarantee the perfect functionality. Please use with caution.**

You can access the tool here:
